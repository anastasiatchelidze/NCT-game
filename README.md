# NCT-game

small project I worked on during the leisure time to have fun while practicing to code in python and also prove that programming can be useful in any aspect of life.

NCT is a Korean boy-band with 23 members! To become their fan one has to learn at least all of their stage name and faces. Therefore user in this game has to enter name of each member one by one. When the guess is correct, name will be written on the picture at the appropriate place (where the guessed member is). Game ends when the user guesses all 23 members of the group or if he/she types 'Exit'.

After the game if there are any members that were not guessed, their names are written and saved into csv file, so later user can use them and learn.
